Dear siteadmin,

this is a default and example text header that is sent with your emails.
You can modify the template modules/advMailer/pntemplates/mailer_text_header.htm and customize this file for your needs.

A better way is to override this template by putting it into your theme's module template folder:
themes/YOURTHEME/templates/modules/advMailer/mailer_text_header.htm
Doing this makes later updates of the Mailer module much easier.
