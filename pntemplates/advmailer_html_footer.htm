<p>
this is a default and example html footer that is sent with your emails.
You can modify the template modules/advMailer/pntemplates/mailer_html_footer.htm and customize this file for your needs.

<i>A better way is to override this template by putting it into your theme's module template folder:
themes/<YOURTHEME>/templates/modules/advMailer/mailer_html_footer.htm
Doing this makes later updates of the Mailer module much easier.</i>
